# social_distancing

-------Project still in progress------
I plan to design a model to that alerts if a person is not following the covid social distancing norms. 
For this, I want to try few person detection models (using cascades, faster RCNN etc) and select the best one. 
I then want to generate a bird-eye view of the model and use euclidian distances between two people to check whether they are following the norms.
